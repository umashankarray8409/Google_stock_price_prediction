In this project I have used python language where we can predict stock price variances using historical dataset of google stock prices.
Where I predicted each year stock price bar graph and then last 10 year stock chart graph and then last 3 year stock chart graph and using last 3 years we can predict future stock price variances.
Here I used LSTM using RNN.
This project aims to predict Google stock prices through a data-driven approach, crucial for investors and financial analysts. Leveraging historical stock price data, various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, ARIMA, and LSTM are employed for forecasting. Data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and feature selection, enhance model accuracy. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) uncovers trends and patterns in the data, informing the modeling process. Model evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) assess predictive performance. Results are compared against actual historical prices, facilitating insights into model robustness and limitations. Challenges like data quality and model complexity are discussed, alongside suggestions for future research. The project underscores the importance of accurate stock price prediction in investment decision-making.
