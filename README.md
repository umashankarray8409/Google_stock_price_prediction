In this project I have used python language where we can predict stock price variances using historical dataset of google stock prices.
Where I predicted each year stock price bar graph and then last 10 year stock chart graph and then last 3 year stock chart graph and using last 3 years we can predict future stock price variances.
Here I used LSTM using RNN.
